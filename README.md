## :bulb: My process
###Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
###Lessons learnt
- I learnt a new way to set background colours by first declaring the colours as global CSS variables, then applying them by using `var()` function.
- I also learnt how to centre the container and attribution.
- I also practiced on writing the markdown.
###Personal development
- At first, I struggled on centring the container as I added the `display: flex;` to the container, instead of the body.
- I also had difficulty moving the attribution from the bottom-left to be below the container as I had added `margin: auto;` to the container.
